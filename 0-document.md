# Research plan summary

The research endeavour proposed in this document aims to explore a phenomenon within contemporary urban bicycling. This phenomenon, *random vélomobile formations-in-action*, describes a serendipitous encounter of bicyclists who happen to ride at a similar pace, in the same direction, for a part of their journey.

Bicycling is, especially for purposes of transportation rather than recreation and leisure, often considered a solitary activity. But social interaction takes place between cyclists and other road users as much as it does between pedestrians. Those interactions are most often indirect and depend highly on culture and the urban environment. My research will explore design openings within the above mentioned *random formations*, focusing on both opportunities for social interactions as well as the representation of the social cycling experience.

# Introduction and background

Bicycling is often considered to be a very solitary activity. But even when we are not riding intentionally in a group --- be it for a bicycle tour or as a group commute --- bicycling can still be a social experience, as it does not take place in isolation, but "in complex choreography with other multi-modal road users" [@outthere].

Compared to other modes of transportation, bicycling offers a unique combination of experiential differences. Bicycling happens 'out there', outside of an enclosed room, which allows us to use all our senses and experience the trip and the environment with our whole body. This allows for complex interaction which would not be possible e.g. within a car. At the same time, bicycling happens at a much higher pace than walking, which limits the range of possible interactions somewhat.

The importance of bicyclists for the socio-urban landscape has been recognized by city planners and social scientists alike. Researchers like Katrina Jungnickel, Rachel Aldred, Paul McIlvenny and Justin Spinney focus on bicycling as a social practice in much of their work. But bicycling communities themselves are starting to put more emphasis on being social as well.

The *Slow Roll* movement ^[See [http://www.slowroll.bike/](http://www.slowroll.bike/)], in analogy to the *Slow Food* movement, promotes a conscious bicycling experience. Bicycling communities meet to ride a tour through their city, along neighbourhoods and points of interest. 'Slow Roll' means to ride at a slow pace, allowing for appreciation of the cycling experience and social interaction.

A less well-defined contemporary phenomenon can be found under the hashtag `#CoffeeOutside` on social media like Twitter and Instagram. On their way cycling to work, people in cities all over the world stop and meet to have a coffee outside, together. While this movement has grown out of coffee enthusiasm, many arrive to the meet-ups by bike, and the notion of togetherness and spending time outside overlap deeply into bicycling culture.

With this new appreciation for social bicycling in mind, I aim to explore a phenomenon that I call *random vélomobile formations-in-action*. 

While some research has happened very close to the project, namely @esbjornsson on motorcycles, @mcilvenny on direct social interaction (and *intentional* bike formations), and @cromwell from an urban perspective, nobody seemed yet to have touched the possibilities the Internet of Things might have for this.

# Research focus

<!-- > Given the elaborated background, this section should lead on to a concise formulation of the research question or knowledge interest that will be the focus for the project.
> A way to structure the problem formulation is to write a short section on the purpose of the study, which is followed by a section on objectives for the study, i.e. why the study is conducted and possible knowledge contributions of the project. The section can list different objectives, points of interest or sub- questions to be explored.
> The above amounts to a hopefully clear research focus, which is finally distilled into a research question – and note that even highly explorative research plans can be framed in research questions. -->

In focus of my research work are what can be described as *temporary formations* in urban bicycle traffic. My goal is to describe 

- How can we make use of the phenomenon 'temporary cyclist formation' in urban traffic (maybe using IoT technologies)
- How can the cycling experience be properly conveyed/represented? focusing on 'temp cyc form' as well?

Objectives:

1. To describe the phenomenon tempCycForm and its characteristics
2. Explore social interaction patterns within that phenomenon
3. Explore design openings that make use of it
4. Design for better/nicer commutes with respect fo tempCycForm

# Literature overview and related work

<!-- > This section gives a critical summary and assessment of the range of existing research within the chosen problem domain. As such, the section positions the project towards the established field of research in the interaction design community (and/or related fields). The section can be seen as a draft for what literature that will be used, arguing for the relevance of that literature. Obviously you will not have done all reading and analysis before the project starts; consider this section to be a first sketch of the literature survey in your final report.
> In view of the proposed research-through-design approach, an equally important part of the section refers to interesting design exemplars and related work performed by others. -->

Not much has been written on cycling as a social experience, and most of it
in the humanities (the social sciences, especially). While there also exist
many studies in the area of traffic research and urban planning, most of them
seem irrelevant to my research. Lastly, there is work in the areas of architecture
and design that touches on the design space I am interested in.

## A framework for social interaction and meaning-making in a velomobile environment 

Marc Auge coined the term 'nscon-place' and uses it to describe mostly spaces of transition and mobility, for example bus stops and trains. They are places "where interactions are structured by rules not defined by the people in them" [@spinney2007]. Auge argues that "we do not find these spaces meaningful", due to their nature of fleetingness, temporality and ephemerality. Spinney opposes this assumption with respect to bicycling, as it is a  and offers an account of meaningful embodied experiences of non-place through his 

TODO: read spinney and insert here [@spinney2007]

While Spinney focuses on the solitary embodied experience of bicycling, @mcilvenny describes formations that bicyclists can assume in order to sustain a conversation. His work is based on Jensen's [-@jensen] 'mobile with' --- an extension of Eugene Goffman's concept of 'single' and 'with' into the realm of mobility. Jensen argues that “in the mundane and
ordinary everyday life we make multiple ‘temporary congregations’ as we are slipping in and out
of different ‘mobile withs’ ... ‘Mobile withs’ might be exemplified by groups of recreational
runners or cyclists” [-@jensen, p. 341]. McIlvenny captures "different vélomobile formations-in-action" using video recordings and . His notion of *vélomobile formations-in-action* build a solid base for the description of temporary bicycling formations, in the following only 
 

'formation' is thus also the term being used in this document to describe a 'group' or 'flock' of bicyclists on the road.

Within this framework of 'mobile with', indirect interaction and formations exists a design space.

# Methodology

<!-- > This section describes the overarching methodological aspect of the project.
> As such, it proposes methods for field studies or other relevant data collection, how design based experiments can be performed, criteria for evaluation and ethical considerations.
> It is highly recommended to build your methodological arguments from your research questions or knowledge interests: if this is what I want to accomplish in terms of knowledge production, how can I proceed to reach the goal? -->

Two factors are of outstanding importance for this research project: sociality and embodiment. They suggest a methodology that is grounded in participatory design, and .
As my research focuses on everyday cycling, it is important to work with everyday cyclists, commuters mainly.

While an ethnographic study might help to describe the phenomenon at hand, it is not sufficient to provide complex accounts 

One method that cristallizes from these prerequisites is *bodystorming*.


To quickly prototype any ideas that would require random encounters with many cyclists on the road, 

* Workshops
* Bodystorming - group storming
* design games

Observation: go and observe bycicle-heavy roads; or go full ethnographic, and go into traffic, maybe following others

Role play: prototype bike traffic with multiple people by means of role play. Not even in real traffic. Just 'play'.

1. Ein Bumper-Sticker, oder eine App, oder eine Weste o.a. die sagt "Ride with me, I'm social"

# Pilot experiment

@jungnickel describes a method of creating time-lapse videos of bicycle rides with the aim of conveying a sense of 'there-ness' resulting from the visual experience. This experiment builds on her method and, in addition to the feeling of 'being-there', tries to convey a sense of the fluctuating social environment during the ride as well. In other words, I aim to represent Jensen's [-@jensen] interpretation of the 'mobile with'.

For this, I recorded photos of two rides around the city of Malmö. Similar to Jungnickel, I composed these photos without any further editing or filtering into a time-lapse video. However, instead of just playing the photos at a constant speed, I alterated the frames per second (FPS) or the video depending on the size of my current formation: when I was riding alone, the video would play at a fast pace, and it would slow down whenever I would be with others; the bigger the formation, the slower the video.

## Setup

After a few short tests with several time-lapse apps, using a smartphone camera proved not to be a feasible solution. The smartphone bike mount that I had access to was, while securing the phone to the handlebars, not made for holding it steady or even holding it in an upright position (so that the camera could point forwards). The images it caught were shaking, alternating in brightness, had blurs (probably because of refocusing) and were --- worst of all --- not very interesting, as they showed mostly my front wheel and part of the road in front of me.
Instead, I used an action camera (in this case a GoPro HD Hero 2). The camera came with a proper bike mount for the handlebars, and is made for 'action' situations, i.e. short exposure, bad lighting conditions, and heavy shaking.
Before starting the ride, I set the camera to time-lapse mode, which means that it captures a picture in defined intervals. I set the interval to be 500ms, which is the shortest interval supported by the camera. This seemed sufficient for the purpose, as @jungnickel used 2-second intervals.

In addition to the equipment for capturing pictures, I used my smartphone to record audio. Using a simple audio recording app and a headset with the microphone placed near my neck, I could record any thoughts and remarks I had during my ride, and thus record any non-visual impression, such as 'how many people are in a formation around me'. 

## Execution

Before going on the ride, I started the audio recording using my smartphone. I then started the GoPro while noting the exact time in my phone. The ride itself was made with a more or less constant pace, but as natural as possible. When ever the number of people around me changed because I joined or left a group, passed someone or was passed by someone, I noted the number of people in my formation with the phone.

This way, I captured two different rides on the same day, in the following referred to as *Ride A* and *Ride B*.

## Post-production

Ride A went for about 30 minutes and captured more than 3000 photos, whereas Ride B went for about 15 minutes and captured about 1500 photos. With the command-line program `ffmpeg` I created a time-lapse video from each of the rides at 30 frames per second (FPS). This would be the speed representing my solitary phases during the ride. Then, using the video editor iMovie, I slowed down all the scenes in which I was in a formation. As this happened manually, the exact speed at which the non-solitary parts of the video would play is not constant, but precise enough to make the viewer understand the connection.

## Result and reflection

The result of this experiment are two time-lapse videos of my bike rides through the city of Malmö.

\begin{figure*}[!ht]
  \centering
  \hspace*{-31.5mm}%*
  \includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=\paperwidth]{rideBstrip.jpg}
  \caption{Still shots from Ride B}
\end{figure*}

In both videos, the solitary time on a bike is longer than the time in a formation. However, in the video to Ride B I am part of a bigger formation --- up to five people at one point. The contrast between the different playback speeds can be 'felt' and seen more clearly in the Ride B video.

Both videos start with a solo ride and the full 30 FPS. Thus, the transitions between individual frames are short and the overall scene gives a smooth visual impression. However, as soon as I build a formation with other cyclists, the number of FPS is (intentionally) cut in half. This is very visible, as not only the playback is slower, but the transitions are sharper. While it is generally good that the change in formation is very noticeable, it is possible that the visual characteristic distracts from the actual message at hand, because it feels like a decrease in quality (which, strictly speaking, it is). With this in mind, it might be worth to try a proper video recording instead of time-lapse in another iteration of the experiment. This way, the video would never fall underneath 30 FPS and would be more pleasant to watch.

# Potential risks

<!-- > Potential risks area often overlooked when setting up research projects. Try to calculate potential risks in the project and if possible reflect on corrective actions for overcoming the identified risks. -->

- People do not like to be in a formation with strangers
- they do not like to interact with strangers
- tempCycForm is not a thing, or is hard to design for
- might have to shift focus to intentional cycling formations, then more referring to Paul McIlvenny
- might have to shift focus to other encounters, such as 'meeting' or 'passing', more looking into Esbjörnsson et al.
