# Summary

The research endeavour proposed in this document aims to explore a phenomenon within contemporary urban bicycling. This phenomenon, dubbed *random vélomobile formations-in-action*, represents a serendipitous encounter of bicyclists who happen to ride at a similar pace, in the same direction, for a part of their respective journeys.

Bicycling is, especially for purposes of transportation rather than recreation and leisure, often considered a solitary activity. But social interaction takes place between cyclists and other road users as much as it does between pedestrians. Those interactions are most often indirect and depend highly on culture and the urban environment. My research will explore design openings within the above mentioned *random formations*, focusing on both opportunities for social interactions as well as the representation of the social cycling experience, and will do so in relation to the bicycle community in the city of Malmö, Sweden.

# Introduction and background

Bicycling is often considered to be a very solitary activity. But even when we are not riding intentionally in a group --- be it for a bicycle tour or as a group commute --- bicycling can still be a social experience, as it does not take place in isolation, but "in complex choreography with other multi-modal road users" [@outthere].

Compared to other modes of transportation, bicycling offers a unique combination of experiential qualities. Bicycling happens 'out there', outside of an enclosed room, which allows us to use all our senses and experience the trip and the environment with our whole body. This allows for complex interaction which would not be possible e.g. within a car. At the same time, bicycling happens at a much higher pace than walking, which limits the range of possible interactions somewhat.

The importance of bicyclists for the socio-urban landscape has been recognized by city planners and social scientists alike. Researchers like Katrina Jungnickel, Rachel Aldred, Paul McIlvenny and Justin Spinney focus on bicycling as a social practice in much of their work. But bicycling communities themselves are starting to put more emphasis on social practice as well.

The *Slow Roll* movement ^[See [http://www.slowroll.bike/](http://www.slowroll.bike/)], in analogy to the *Slow Food* movement, promotes a more conscious bicycling experience. Bicycling communities meet to ride a tour through their city, along neighbourhoods and points of interest. 'Slow Roll' means to ride at a slow pace, allowing for appreciation of the cycling experience and social interaction. *Slow Roll* was started in Detroit, MI, USA in 2010 and has since spread over 9 other cities. It is safe to assume that many more informal meet-ups of this kind are taking place in many parts of the world.

\end{figure*}

A less well-defined social phenomenon can be observed under the hashtag `#CoffeeOutside` on social media like Twitter and Instagram. On their way cycling to work, people in cities all over the world stop and meet to have a coffee outside, together. While this movement has emerged from coffee enthusiasm, many arrive to the meet-ups by bike, and the notion of togetherness and spending time outside overlap deeply into bicycling culture.

With this new appreciation for social bicycling in mind, I aim to explore a phenomenon that I call *random vélomobile formations-in-action*, which will be described further in the following section. Some research has happened touching this phenomenon, namely @esbjornsson on encounters when motorcycling, @mcilvenny on *intentional* rather than *random* vélomobile formations-in-action, and @cromwell with an urban planning approach to indirect social interaction on bikes. Yet so far no one has explored the interaction design space encompassing this phenomenon.

# Research focus

In focus of my research work are *random vélomobile formations-in-action* in urban bicycle traffic. Paul McIlvenny describes vélomobile formations-in-action as "specific arrangements of bodies on
bikes and configurations of a 'vélomobile with'" [-@mcilvenny]. His work focuses on two or more people on bikes *intentionally* riding together and trying to maintain a conversation. In *random* vélomobile formations-in-action, however, this intentionality is missing. Rather, these formations describe temporary arrangements of bikes and people who are most likely strangers, and just happen to ride together at the same time, at a similar pace, for part of their respective journeys. This phenomenon occurs frequently in urban bicycle traffic, yet we seldom make note of it. The following imaginary narrative describes an instance of the phenomenon:

> Johan's commute leads him from Rönneholm in Malmö to the city's university in the western harbour. Early in this journey, he passes in front of the city library on Kung Oscars väg and turns left onto Slottsgatan, which immediately overpasses Fersens bro, a slightly ascending canal bridge. While taking the left turn, Johan moves into traffic next to Marie, who was approaching from his right. At this spot, the bike lane is wide enough for the two to ride side-by-side. As they are ascending Fersens bro, they maintain more or less the same pace and stay next to each other. After the climax, the bike lane narrows down. Johan sprints forward in order to slip in the front of Marie, making space for oncoming cyclists riding into the opposite direction. They continue to ride in a formation (in line, "singled up") until Marie turns right towards Stortorget.

During their time on Fersens bro and after, Johan and Marie are in a 'vélomobile with' and form a random vélomobile formation-in-action. They negotiate their formation with respect to each others cycling abilities and the current environment, without having met each other before.

My research will be an exploration into the possibilities this phenomenon affords and can be distilled into two major questions:

1. How can we design for social interaction to take place during random encounters of bicyclists in vélomobile formations-in-action? How can this (neutral) randomness be turned into (pleasant) serendipity?
2. How can random vélomobile formations-in-action be constructively presented in order to convey a richer account of their experience?

These questions are to be approached using the following objectives:

- Describe the phenomenon at hand using both ethnographic as well as phenomenological accounts
- Explore design openings that exploit the phenomenon
- Create and execute design experiments that raise interaction design knowledge regarding the phenomenon 

# Literature overview and related work

Bicycling as a social practice has so far been covered by the humanities, especially by the social sciences.
While there also exist
many studies in the area of traffic research and urban planning, most of them
seem irrelevant to my research. Lastly, there is work in the areas of architecture
and design that touches on the design space that encompasses random vélomobile formations-in-action.
 
## A framework for social interaction and meaning-making in a vélomobile environment

Marc Augé coined the term 'non-place' and used it to describe spaces of transition and mobility, for example bus stops and motorways. They are places "where interactions are structured by rules not defined by the people in them" [@spinney2007]. Augé argues that "we do not find these spaces meaningful", due to their nature of fleetingness, temporality and ephemerality. Spinney opposes this assumption with respect to bicycling, as cyclists engage with their socio-urban environment in an embodied and sensory way. He offers an account of meaningful embodied experiences of non-place by means of a narrative of an imaginary bicycle ride through London.

While Spinney focuses on the solitary embodied experience of bicycling, @mcilvenny describes formations that bicyclists can assume in order to sustain a conversation. His work is based on Jensen's [-@jensen] 'mobile with' --- a transfer of Erving Goffman's concept of 'single' and 'with' into the realm of mobility. Jensen argues that “in the mundane and
ordinary everyday life we make multiple ‘temporary congregations’ as we are slipping in and out
of different ‘mobile withs’ ... ‘Mobile withs’ might be exemplified by groups of recreational
runners or cyclists” [-@jensen, p. 341]. McIlvenny captures "different vélomobile formations-in-action" using video recordings and analyses them, creating a portfolio of different formations used to sustain social interaction between two or more people on bikes. His notion of *vélomobile formations-in-action* build a solid base for the description of the phenomenon that this research proposal addresses. Within this framework of 'mobile with', indirect interaction and formations-in-action exists an interaction design space that is largely unexplored.

Of special relevance to my research is also the work done by Katrina Jungnickel and Rachel Aldred. Their research [e.g. @aldred2010; @aldred2012; @jungnickel_cyclings_2014] explores the cultural and societal sides of bicycling: the relationship between the riders and other riders, their ride, the environment, and the socio-political space. They give an extensive account of the diverse bicycling cultures in different British cities.

Promising seems also the notion of transferring the *flaneur* to the world of bicycling. It is approached most prominently by @flaneur, but is also adapted by @esbjornsson to motorcycling.

## Tangents to the design space

Looking at bicycling and mobility, one can see many smartphone applications that aim to enhance the ride experience. While most of them are targeted towards professional and recreational bicycling (e.g. Strava, Map My Ride, Runtastic) and some towards activism (e.g. Bikes vs. Cars, Charity Miles, Social Cyclist), it is hard to find examples that touch on sociality or serendipity in-action.

@esbjornsson describe Hocman, a mobile application that fosters interaction between motorcyclists to complement random encounters on the road. @cromwell approaches indirect social interaction between bicyclists (which include random vélomobile formations-in-action) from a perspective of landscape architecture, designing bicycle facilities to enhance the social experience of everyday bicycling. However, the interaction design space seems largely unexplored.

# Methodology

There are two factors that are of outstanding importance for this research project: sociality and embodiment. They both afford certain methodological approaches, which are described in this section.

Much of the existing literature listed in the previous section is grounded in ethnographic studies. While I can make use of these, I have to pay attention to the fact that bicycling is cultural and social behaviour is depending on context, which is why I will have to do ethnographic studies myself in Malmö. Specifically, these studies can be carried out in two different ways. One is to observe cyclists and their behaviour *in situ*, using recording equipment such as an action camera (see also the pilot experiment in section \ref{pilot-experiment}), or simply by writing down observations. The other way is to engage actively with bicyclists through surveys, interviews, and workshops.

Bicycling is a highly embodied activity, carried out with the whole body and experienced with all our senses. As such it affords a performative approach to design. I plan to work with bodystorming in order to explore the design space, as well as with role-play and experience prototyping in order to quickly prototype any ideas that would otherwise require random encounters with many cyclists on the road. 

While in the beginning the work will be rather explorative, I plan on working closely with bicyclists in later stages of the project in a *participatory design* practice. This way I ensure that my work does not loose touch with existing bicycling practice.

# Collaboration

While there are no concrete external stakeholders in this project, my research addresses the larger Malmö bicycling community.
During the preparation of this research plan, I have created a (metaphorical) map of the Malmö bicycling landscape. It includes bike stores, repair shops, bicycle-focused meeting points such as cafés^[Examples are Solde, Musette, and Bianchi], community initiatives such as Cykelköket, as well as bicycle clubs and community-based movements^[For example Slow Roll Malmö, CK Avanti, Pista Malmö, and several Facebook groups].
Getting to know Malmö's bicycling culture allows me to adapt my design activities, and gives me access to potential participants for workshops, design experiments, and user testing.

# Expected results

With this research, I aim to contribute to the already existing body of knowledge on bicycling as a social practice. Most literature originates in the social sciences, and a designerly account seems overdue. Instead of barely describing the phenomenon, interaction design can exploit it and produce knowledge that allows us to design for the enjoyment of everyday bicycling.

During my research I will carry out design experiments. Most of these experiments will lead to immaterial design knowledge, which will compose the final thesis document. I expect to learn how to efficiently prototype in a vélomobile environment that is beyond any designer's control. I also expect to design a method that allows me to represent and convey the phenomenon at hand to others. This method will most certainly make use of videography, but might be multi-modal as well.

In addition, some of these experiments might yield artefacts that encourage or make use of social interaction in random vélomobile formations-in-action. These artefacts could be relevant to external communities, namely the bicycling community of Malmö (and maybe beyond). The artefacts may stand for themselves, or act to enhance an existing bicycling culture, such as built by the Slow Roll group in Malmö.

# Activity plan

Due to my background in software engineering, I have adapted an *agile* mindset of project management, along with methods like Kanban and SCRUM. This design research project is, however, quite different from a typical software engineering project. All I want to transfer from the agile mindset to this project is the notion of *embracing change*, as I will constantly have to reflect on the current state of the project, and the terminology of *sprints*. A sprint is, simply put, an arbitrary period of time at which beginning you define what is to be done within the sprint, and at which end you measure and reflect on what you have achieved. For this project I will plan with week-long sprints.

The project has a few pre-defined dates of importance:

March 30, 2015
  ~ Start of the project (kick-off sprint 1)

May 1, 2015
  ~ Hand in a 75% version of the report (end of sprint 5)

May 25, 2015
  ~ Hand in the final report (kick-off sprint 9)

June 2--3, 2015
  ~ Present and defend your work in a seminar (sprint 10)

\begin{figure*}[!ht]
  \centering
  \hspace*{-31.5mm}%*
  \includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=\paperwidth]{../schedule-clean.pdf}
  \caption{Activity plan}
\end{figure*}

Figure 2 shows a chart of the activities to be carried out within the individual sprints. Due to the agile nature of the project approach, this chart is only to be seen as tentative and not final (*embracing change*). The overlap of different activities is intentional. The chart lists the following activities:

- Ethnographic study
- Design of experiments
- Design of workshops
- Carrying out workshops and experiments
- Write
- Edit, revise, finalise
- Prepare presentation

It can be seen that for the actual project work, there are only 8 weeks of time scheduled (or 8 sprints). This is a potential risk, further listed in section \ref{potential-risks}. Thus, the first three activities (ethnographic study, design of experiments, design of workshops) are scheduled with a little buffer and are expected to be finished earlier than scheduled. However, depending on their nature, some experiments might be long-running and might extend well into the writing phase. This schedule does not account for any corrections to be carried out after the presentation.

# Pilot experiment

@jungnickel describes a method of creating time-lapse videos of bicycle rides with the aim of conveying a sense of 'there-ness' resulting from the visual experience. This experiment builds on her method and, in addition to the feeling of 'being-there', tries to convey a sense of the fluctuating social environment during the ride as well. In other words, I aim to represent Jensen's [-@jensen] interpretation of the 'mobile with'.

For this, I recorded photos of two rides around the city of Malmö. Similar to Jungnickel, I composed these photos without any further editing or filtering into a time-lapse video. However, instead of just playing the photos at a constant speed, I modified the frames per second (FPS) of the video depending on the size of my current formation: when I was riding alone, the video would play at a fast pace, and it would slow down whenever I would be with others; the bigger the formation, the slower the video.

## Setup

After a few short tests with several time-lapse applications, using a mobile phone camera for image capture proved not to be feasible. The bike mount I had available did not allow for the phone to be in an upright position (so that the camera could point forwards). The images it caught were shaking, alternating in brightness, had blurs (probably because of refocusing) and were --- worst of all --- not very interesting, as they showed mostly my front wheel and part of the road in front of me.
Instead, I used an action camera (in this case a GoPro HD Hero 2). The camera came with a proper bike mount for the handlebars, and is made for 'action' situations, i.e. short exposure, bad lighting conditions, and heavy shaking.
Before starting the ride, I set the camera to time-lapse mode, which means that it captures  still images in defined intervals. I set the interval to be 500ms, which is the shortest interval supported by the camera. This seemed sufficient for the purpose, as @jungnickel used 2-second intervals.

In addition to the equipment for capturing pictures, I used my phone to record audio. Using a simple audio recording application and a headset with the microphone placed near my neck, I could record any thoughts and remarks I had during my ride, and thus record any non-visual impression, namely the side of my current vélomobile formation-in-action.

## Execution

Before going on the ride, I started the audio recording on my phone. I then started the action camera while noting the exact time in my phone. The ride itself was made at a more or less constant pace, but as natural as possible. When ever the number of people around me changed because I joined or left a formation, passed someone, or was passed by someone, I noted the number of people in my formation using the audio recording.
This way, I captured two different rides on the same day, in the following referred to as *Ride A* and *Ride B*.

## Post-production

Ride A went for about 30 minutes and captured more than 3000 photos, whereas Ride B went for about 15 minutes and captured more than 1500 photos. With the command-line program `ffmpeg` I created a time-lapse video from each of the rides at 30 frames per second (FPS). This would be the speed representing my solitary phases during the ride. Then, using the video editor iMovie, I slowed down all the scenes in which I was part of a formation. As I carried out this modification manually, the exact speed at which the non-solitary parts of the video play is not constant, but precise enough to make the viewer understand the connection.

## Result and reflection

The result of this experiment are two time-lapse videos of my bike rides through the city of Malmö.

\begin{figure*}[!ht]
  \centering
  \hspace*{-31.5mm}%*
  \includegraphics[keepaspectratio,width=\paperwidth]{rideBstrip.jpg}
  \caption{Still shots from Ride B}
\end{figure*}

In both videos, the solitary parts ('single') are significantly more prominent than the parts I am part of a formation ('with'). However, in the video of Ride B I am part of a bigger formation --- up to five people at one point. The contrast between the different playback speeds can be 'felt' and seen quite clearly here, more so than in the video of Ride A.

Both videos start with a solo ride and the full 30 FPS. Thus, the transitions between individual frames are short and the overall scene gives a smooth visual impression. However, as soon as I slip into a formation with other cyclists, the number of FPS is (intentionally) cut in half. This is very visible, as not only the playback is slower, but the transitions are sudden and somewhat 'choppy'. While it is generally beneficial that the change in formation is very noticeable, the visual characteristic distracts from the actual message at hand, because it feels like a decrease in quality (which, strictly speaking, it is). With this in mind, it might be worth to utilise a proper video recording instead of time-lapse in another iteration of the experiment. This way, the video would never fall underneath 30 FPS and would be more pleasant to watch.

# Potential risks

The most obvious risk in this project is presented by the time constraint of about eight weeks (sprints 1--8, as described in section \ref{activity-plan}). This is a tight schedule for a Master's level research work, but it is a risk that can be --- at least partially --- be planned for. In the activity plan (Figure 2) I assigned three sprints for the carrying out of experiments. If experiments run slightly longer, their results can still be included in the final report. If they run *significantly* longer, however, as may be the case with community projects that have to be established over time, it might be worth to either discard them or extend the project runtime into the summer.

Another potential risk is that the Malmö bicycling culture might be hard to influence or disrupt. If the community is not open for new propositions, it might hinder the design process and force me to rely on ethnographic and methodological work only.

While most Swedes speak English, the language difference between me and Malmö's cyclists can be seen as a potential difficulty, too.

Finally, there is the risk that no feasible design openings can be found for random vélomobile formations-in-action. This is rather unlikely, but in this case I will have to either reframe the research question either to a slightly different (possibly neighbouring) phenomenon, or open my research up to more abstract questions.
