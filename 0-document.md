# Research plan summary

<!-- > An overall research plan summary. Write this section after you have completed the rest of the document. Summarize your approach as concisely as possible so that readers can quickly understand the fundamentals of your plan. The summary can be seen as an equivalent to the paper/article abstract. -->

# Introduction and background

, cycling does not take place in isolation.
It happens in all weather, in and around multiple infrastruc-
tures, in complex choreography with other multi-modal
road users. It is interwoven with the urban fabric, every-
day practice and the lives of others.

- Bicycling has started to be recognised as a 
- cycling is not only solitary, but can be a very social activity
- bike is one of the most simple transportation devices, hasnt changed much in recent years; don't put too much technology in, don't change the being of the bike

While some research has happened very close to the project, namely @esbjornsson on motorcycles, @mcilvenny on direct social interaction (and *intentional* bike formations), and @cromwell from an urban perspective, nobody seemed yet to have touched the possibilities the Internet of Things might have for this.

<!-- > Here you should give a contextual background and setting of the stage of the research project. Facts and references can be used to show that the project is;
    - Relevant
    - Not already over-researched - Feasible
    - Ethically defensible
> In doing so, the introduction introduces the problem domain and explicates why the research project is relevant. It gives a brief overview of the field, which is expanded later in the section “Literature overview and related work”. If references are used they should be cited correctly. It is suggested that you also address why and for whom the project is relevant.
> The introduction should include a first presentation of external stakeholders (if any). -->

# Research focus
<!-- > Given the elaborated background, this section should lead on to a concise formulation of the research question or knowledge interest that will be the focus for the project.
> A way to structure the problem formulation is to write a short section on the purpose of the study, which is followed by a section on objectives for the study, i.e. why the study is conducted and possible knowledge contributions of the project. The section can list different objectives, points of interest or sub- questions to be explored.
> The above amounts to a hopefully clear research focus, which is finally distilled into a research question – and note that even highly explorative research plans can be framed in research questions. -->

- How can Internet-of-Things technologies support cycling as a social activity?
- How can we make use of the phenomenon 'temporary cyclist formation' in urban traffic (maybe using IoT technologies)
- How can the cycling experience be properly conveyed/represented? maybe focusing on 'temp cyc form' as well?

Objectives:

1. To describe the phenomenon tempCycForm and its characteristics
2. Explore social interaction patterns within that phenomenon
3. Explore design openings that make use of it
4. Design for better/nicer commutes with respect fo tempCycForm

# Literature overview and related work

<!-- > This section gives a critical summary and assessment of the range of existing research within the chosen problem domain. As such, the section positions the project towards the established field of research in the interaction design community (and/or related fields). The section can be seen as a draft for what literature that will be used, arguing for the relevance of that literature. Obviously you will not have done all reading and analysis before the project starts; consider this section to be a first sketch of the literature survey in your final report.
> In view of the proposed research-through-design approach, an equally important part of the section refers to interesting design exemplars and related work performed by others. -->

The range of existing work I base my research on can be generally divided into two sources: social sciences and design, with the former accounting for the gross of examples.

## Social sciences

Social interaction and meaning-making in a velomobile environment

* Actor-network theory: Bruno Latour et al -> group forming
* Marc Auge, place, space, non-space, urban spaces, place-specific computing
* Kat Jungnickel, Rachel Aldred
* McIlvenny, Jensen 'mobile with'
* Justin Spinney vs Auge/non-place

Wie war das mit indirect und direct interaction?

## Design, Architecture

* Design Noir
* IoT
* vllt was von wegen 'design for serendipity, encounters'? TODO: literatur vom ersten kurs nachschauen
* Esbjörnsson et al Motorcycling & social interaction @esbjornsson
* Cromwell und sein social act of bicycling @cromwell

Jensen (2010)
proposes that we study what he calls the “mobile with.” Jensen argues that “in the mundane and
ordinary everyday life we make multiple ‘temporary congregations’ as we are slipping in and out
of different ‘mobile withs’ . . . ‘Mobile withs’ might be exemplified by groups of recreational
runners or cyclists [italics added]” (p. 341).

In regard to interactional formations, Kendon (1990b, p. 209) describes how “people often
group themselves into clusters, lines, or circles, or into various other kinds of patterns. These
patterns may be highly fluid or they may be relatively sustained. When such a pattern is sustained
it will be referred to as a formation.”

Once moving together, co-riders need to sustain a shared pace, otherwise co-presence cannot
be maintained, the mobile formation dissolves, and talk or interaction is no longer possible. As
we shall see later, formations can be stretched without breaking, and thus interactions have an
elasticity that requires co-riders to attend to their mobility as and with their talk-in-motion.

# Methodology

<!-- > This section describes the overarching methodological aspect of the project.
> As such, it proposes methods for field studies or other relevant data collection, how design based experiments can be performed, criteria for evaluation and ethical considerations.
> It is highly recommended to build your methodological arguments from your research questions or knowledge interests: if this is what I want to accomplish in terms of knowledge production, how can I proceed to reach the goal? -->

\emph{beccy ist toll}

* Workshops
* Bodystorming - group storming
* Game prototyping

Observation: go and observe bycicle-heavy roads; or go full ethnographic, and go into traffic, maybe following others

Role play: prototype bike traffic with multiple people by means of role play. Not even in real traffic. Just 'play'.

# Collaboration

<!-- > Here all stakeholders are described, including their role in the project. Included are issues of recruitment of participants and communication channels that will be used. Names and positions of key people should be included. -->

* Sigma Connectivity
* IOTAP - ECOS - Jonas Lowgren
* Andere Personen:
  - Francesco
  - Roberto

# Expected results

- How to prototype IoT stuff in a velomobile environment
- tempCycForm

<!-- > Here you should describe expected results and outcomes of the project. Contributions can be related to other fields or stakeholder organizations/communities, but the focus should be on knowledge contributions to the field of interaction design research.
> “Internally”, you should suggest what knowledge you expect to produce and consider how it can be seen as a contribution to the academic interaction design community. You should also address how your expected knowledge contributions relate to different forms of knowledge such as reflective analytical knowledge contributions, designed artifacts or methodological contributions.
> “Externally”, contributions can be discussed in terms of what they might mean outside of the academic interaction design community. This can be in terms of, e.g., use qualities, market effects or societal changes. -->

# Activity plan, schedule

Milestones:

<!-- > You identify the key milestones of the planned project, and the main activities needed to reach the milestones. The activities are synthesized in a schedule covering the project period, and ideally it is also presented in visual form (using, e.g., a Gantt diagram).
> The schedule should also indicate critical paths and potential bottlenecks. Depending on the nature of the planned project, it may be necessary to provide a more detailed schedule for initial phases and then leave the rest of the schedule at a more general level. -->

# Pilot experiment

<!-- As part of the research plan, one or more pilot experiments addressing the research framing should be performed, as part of the Design-based research course. The experiments can take on different character depending on the framing of the project. For instance, it can be a smaller design intervention, which illustrates potential problems or design openings in relation to the project, or it can be a material exploration.
> Similarly, the takeaway can differ depending on the nature of the project. In some cases, it might yield insights into design openings informing the introduction of the thesis. In other cases, the experiments may support the formulation of a concise research question, or decisions pertaining to research methodology. -->

@jungnickel describes a method of creating time-lapse videos of bicycle rides with the aim of presenting the being-there, feeling-there, seeing-there, making-there.

The aim of this experiment was to find out how temporary bike-a-licious sociality during a bike ride --- the feeling of being 'with' --- could be visually represented. It is based on work by Kat Jungnickel, who describes how she uses time-lapse video techniques to capture 'the view from the saddle', and extended by a time-warping/distorting component.

## How?

- Ride a tour around the city
- record, by time and gps, the route as video as well as with how many people i am
- the latter has to be wizard-of-oz'ed

## Setup

After a few short tests with several time-lapse apps, using a smartphone camera proved not to be a feasible solution. The smartphone bike mount that I had access to was, while securing the phone to the handlebars, not made for holding it steady or even holding it in an upright position (so that the camera could point forwards). The images it caught were shaking extremely, alternating in brightness a lot, had blurs (probably because of refocusing) and were - worst of all - not very interesting, as they showed mostly my front wheel and part of the road in front of me.
Instead, I used an action camera (in this case a GoPro HD Hero 2). The camera came with a proper bike mount for the handlebars, and is made for 'action' situation, i.e. short exposure, bad lighting conditions, and heavy shaking.
Before starting the ride, I set to camera to time-lapse mode, which means that it captures a picture in defined intervals. I set the interval to be 500ms, which is the shortest interval supported by the camera, but it also seemed sufficient for the purpose (Jungnickel used 2-second intervals).

In addition to the equipment for capturing pictures, I used my smartphone to record audio. Using a simple audio recording app and a headset with the microphone placed near my neck, I could record any thoughts and remarks I had during my ride, and thus record any non-visual impression, such as 'how many people are in a formation around me'. 

## Execution

- Start gopro and audio recording at exact same time
- go on ride
- try to ride at a more or less constant pace, not too fast
- whenever the number of people around me changes, i say the number so it's recorded

## Post-production

- Create video from images
n = number of people in group, me including
m = max people i have ever been with during ride (including me)
fps = (m+1-n)/5
- how else? blur the outside when i am alone...

## Result

- Dynamic-speed time-lapse video of a cycling experience. Sense of being-there, seeing-there, feeling-there.

# Potential risks

<!-- > Potential risks area often overlooked when setting up research projects. Try to calculate potential risks in the project and if possible reflect on corrective actions for overcoming the identified risks. -->

- People do not like to be in a formation with strangers
- they do not like to interact with strangers
- tempCycForm is not a thing, or is hard to design for
- might have to shift focus to intentional cycling formations, then more referring to Paul McIlvenny
- might have to shift focus to other encounters, such as 'meeting' or 'passing', more looking into Esbjörnsson et al.
