# Research plan summary

<!-- > An overall research plan summary. Write this section after you have completed the rest of the document. Summarize your approach as concisely as possible so that readers can quickly understand the fundamentals of your plan. The summary can be seen as an equivalent to the paper/article abstract. -->

# Introduction and background

, cycling does not take place in isolation.
It happens in all weather, in and around multiple infrastruc-
tures, in complex choreography with other multi-modal
road users. It is interwoven with the urban fabric, every-
day practice and the lives of others.

- Bicycling has started to be recognised as a 
- cycling is not only solitary, but can be a very social activity
- bike is one of the most simple transportation devices, hasnt changed much in recent years; don't put too much technology in, don't change the being of the bike
- 

<!-- > Here you should give a contextual background and setting of the stage of the research project. Facts and references can be used to show that the project is;
    - Relevant
    - Not already over-researched - Feasible
    - Ethically defensible
> In doing so, the introduction introduces the problem domain and explicates why the research project is relevant. It gives a brief overview of the field, which is expanded later in the section “Literature overview and related work”. If references are used they should be cited correctly. It is suggested that you also address why and for whom the project is relevant.
> The introduction should include a first presentation of external stakeholders (if any). -->

# Research focus

<!-- > Given the elaborated background, this section should lead on to a concise formulation of the research question or knowledge interest that will be the focus for the project.
> A way to structure the problem formulation is to write a short section on the purpose of the study, which is followed by a section on objectives for the study, i.e. why the study is conducted and possible knowledge contributions of the project. The section can list different objectives, points of interest or sub- questions to be explored.
> The above amounts to a hopefully clear research focus, which is finally distilled into a research question – and note that even highly explorative research plans can be framed in research questions. -->

- How can Internet-of-Things technologies support cycling as a social activity?
- How can we make use of the phenomenon 'temporary cyclist formation' in urban traffic (maybe using IoT technologies)
- How can the cycling experience be properly conveyed/represented? maybe focusing on 'temp cyc form' as well?

Objectives:

1. To describe the phenomenon tempCycForm and its characteristics
2. Explore social interaction patterns within that phenomenon
3. Explore design openings that make use of it
4. Design for better/nicer commutes with respect fo tempCycForm

# Literature overview and related work

<!-- > This section gives a critical summary and assessment of the range of existing research within the chosen problem domain. As such, the section positions the project towards the established field of research in the interaction design community (and/or related fields). The section can be seen as a draft for what literature that will be used, arguing for the relevance of that literature. Obviously you will not have done all reading and analysis before the project starts; consider this section to be a first sketch of the literature survey in your final report.
> In view of the proposed research-through-design approach, an equally important part of the section refers to interesting design exemplars and related work performed by others. -->

Kat Jungnickel on how to work with video, and stuff
Paul McIlvenny's notion of a 'with'
Jensen (2010)
proposes that we study what he calls the “mobile with.” Jensen argues that “in the mundane and
ordinary everyday life we make multiple ‘temporary congregations’ as we are slipping in and out
of different ‘mobile withs’ . . . ‘Mobile withs’ might be exemplified by groups of recreational
runners or cyclists [italics added]” (p. 341).

In regard to interactional formations, Kendon (1990b, p. 209) describes how “people often
group themselves into clusters, lines, or circles, or into various other kinds of patterns. These
patterns may be highly fluid or they may be relatively sustained. When such a pattern is sustained
it will be referred to as a formation.” @hoffman_urban_2014

Once moving together, co-riders need to sustain a shared pace, otherwise co-presence cannot
be maintained, the mobile formation dissolves, and talk or interaction is no longer possible. As
we shall see later, formations can be stretched without breaking, and thus interactions have an
elasticity that requires co-riders to attend to their mobility as and with their talk-in-motion.

# Methodology

<!-- > This section describes the overarching methodological aspect of the project.
> As such, it proposes methods for field studies or other relevant data collection, how design based experiments can be performed, criteria for evaluation and ethical considerations.
> It is highly recommended to build your methodological arguments from your research questions or knowledge interests: if this is what I want to accomplish in terms of knowledge production, how can I proceed to reach the goal? -->

* Workshops
* Bodystorming - group storming
* Game prototyping

Observation: go and observe bycicle-heavy roads; or go full ethnographic, and go into traffic, maybe following others

Role play: prototype bike traffic with multiple people by means of role play. Not even in real traffic. Just 'play'.

# Collaboration

<!-- > Here all stakeholders are described, including their role in the project. Included are issues of recruitment of participants and communication channels that will be used. Names and positions of key people should be included. -->

* Sigma Connectivity
* IOTAP - ECOS - Jonas Lowgren
* Andere Personen:
  - Francesco
  - Roberto

# Expected results

- How to prototype IoT stuff in a velomobile environment
- tempCycForm

<!-- > Here you should describe expected results and outcomes of the project. Contributions can be related to other fields or stakeholder organizations/communities, but the focus should be on knowledge contributions to the field of interaction design research.
> “Internally”, you should suggest what knowledge you expect to produce and consider how it can be seen as a contribution to the academic interaction design community. You should also address how your expected knowledge contributions relate to different forms of knowledge such as reflective analytical knowledge contributions, designed artifacts or methodological contributions.
> “Externally”, contributions can be discussed in terms of what they might mean outside of the academic interaction design community. This can be in terms of, e.g., use qualities, market effects or societal changes. -->

# Activity plan, schedule

Milestones:

<!-- > You identify the key milestones of the planned project, and the main activities needed to reach the milestones. The activities are synthesized in a schedule covering the project period, and ideally it is also presented in visual form (using, e.g., a Gantt diagram).
> The schedule should also indicate critical paths and potential bottlenecks. Depending on the nature of the planned project, it may be necessary to provide a more detailed schedule for initial phases and then leave the rest of the schedule at a more general level. -->

# Pilot experiment

<!-- As part of the research plan, one or more pilot experiments addressing the research framing should be performed, as part of the Design-based research course. The experiments can take on different character depending on the framing of the project. For instance, it can be a smaller design intervention, which illustrates potential problems or design openings in relation to the project, or it can be a material exploration.
> Similarly, the takeaway can differ depending on the nature of the project. In some cases, it might yield insights into design openings informing the introduction of the thesis. In other cases, the experiments may support the formulation of a concise research question, or decisions pertaining to research methodology. -->

The aim of this experiment was to find out how temporary bike-a-licious sociality during a bike ride --- the feeling of being 'with' --- could be visually represented. It is based on work by Kat Jungnickel, who describes how she uses time-lapse video techniques to capture 'the view from the saddle', and extended by a time-warping/distorting component.

## How?

- Ride a tour around the city
- record, by time and gps, the route as video as well as with how many people i am
- the latter has to be wizard-of-oz'ed

## Setup

- GoPro camera mounted (on a helm? on the handlebars!)
- Set to time-lapse, which means capturing pictures in certain intervals. every 200ms? 500ms?
- Phone with an audio recording app, in my pocket
- headset in phone and near my neck, so I can speak into it (and record that)

## Execution

- Start gopro and audio recording at exact same time
- go on ride
- try to ride at a more or less constant pace, not too fast
- whenever the number of people around me changes, i say the number so it's recorded

## Post-production

- Create video from images
n = number of people in group, me including
m = max people i have ever been with during ride (including me)
fps = (m+1-n)/5
- how else? blur the outside when i am alone...

## Result

- Dynamic-speed time-lapse video of a cycling experience. Sense of being-there, seeing-there, feeling-there.

# Potential risks

<!-- > Potential risks area often overlooked when setting up research projects. Try to calculate potential risks in the project and if possible reflect on corrective actions for overcoming the identified risks. -->

- People do not like to be in a formation with strangers
- they do not like to interact with strangers
- tempCycForm is not a thing, or is hard to design for
- might have to shift focus to intentional cycling formations, then more referring to Paul McIlvenny
- might have to shift focus to other encounters, such as 'meeting' or 'passing', more looking into Esbjörnsson et al.
