## Social Sciences

- McIlvenny, *Velomobile formations-in-action*
  The focus is on direct interaction in bycicles, when two or more people (intentionally) ride together.
  McIlvenny shows different 'formations' of bikes, used to make the

  - *Jumps, Stutters, Blurs and Other Failed Images: Using Time-Lapse Video in Cycling Research*
    Inspiration for my time-lapse experiment. Kat argues that the 'failed' images are to be kept, because they
    honestly show what the bike ride was like, in all its roughness. She puts a lot of emphasis on the notion of
    being-there, feeling-there, seeing-there, and making-there.
- David Skinner, Paul Rosen, *Hell is Other Cyclists: Rethinking Transport and Identity*
- Justin Spinney, *Cycling the City: Non-Place and the Sensory Construction of Meaning in a Mobile Practice*
  Argues against bicycling taking place in Auge's notion of *non-place*.

## Design / Architecture / Urban Planning

- Peter Cromwell, *The Social Act of Bicycling Designing Bicycle Facilities to Foster Social Interaction*
  While focused on urban planning, this is quite interesting stuff, because
  Cromwell describes (while including several key sources, such as XXX)
  the differen ways social interaction can happen while riding the bike.
  However, all his assumptions do not seem to be grounded in ethnographic
  field work, but rather by theoretically combining XXXs notion of direct and
  indirect interaction with bicycling.
