# Bike initiatives in Malmo

* Malmo bike tours
* bike&ride parking at centralen
* bike shops
* Cykelkoket
* bike rental (commercial, not sharing)
* GPS http://www.copenhagenize.com/2010/05/gps-for-cyclists-in-malmo-sweden.html

Gatukontoret

Copenhagen electric bike sharing; tablet, gps, ... If the system detects that a certain dock is getting more reservation requests than it has bikes, it pings nearby cyclists with an offer: Leave your bike at the requested location when you’re done and you’ll get credit toward future rides

low entry bike sharing in cph fails, barrier is too low so people are jerks and dont share

boston, hubway: requires credit card, makes it no longer anonymous

- How would a proper peer-to-peer bike sharing service look like? community based, local
- How do cyclists shapre the cityscape, and how does the city influence the cycling experience?
- How is the dynamic between city, spaces, cyclists, pedestrians, motor traffic, buildings, time, parks?
- environmental friendly, efficient, clean
- How can we use IoT techniques to enhance the cycling experience in Malmo, without entfremden the bike from its user, without alienating cyclists from each other / rather connecting them, and especially without making the bike unmaintainable. without removing its simplicity, cleanliness, maintainability, modularity. not like the velour bike does it. compare repairability of cars 20yrs ago, with the repairability of modern cars. we dont want to make the bike a computer...



Haha, if I only knew ;) At the moment I am still trying to figure out in which direction this will go, but let me try to give you some idea.

I am studying Interaction Design, which means I focus on designing systems and things for people. Oftentimes, Interaction Design is about websites and apps, or even interactive hardware/devices, but you can also design for systems, frameworks or societal issues, without any technological aspect.

My upcoming thesis should explore possiblities that "Internet of Things" technology might have for cycling. There are already some projects going on in that area, namely "smart" or "connected" bikes, navigation assistants, smart locks that unlock on proximity, anti-theft systems etc. However, most of there are all quite standalone technologies without any social factor. I would like to look into a more "social" direction, focusing on the cycling experience itself, the dynamic between the cyclist and the city, and between groups of cyclists.

I am still lacking a proper research question, so my work is at the moment very explorative. But I would like to connect to people who might be good sources of information and inspiration: people who like to ride the bike, be it for commuting, sports, or fun. Or for that matter, people who hate cycling and do it anyway ;)

So yeah, I am looking to connect with cyclists mostly and people who know the bicycle scene in Malmo. For example, are there bicycle events? Free bike tours? Are there maybe even bicycle clubs?

These networks are potentially transient, existing in a constant making and re-making
Actants denote human and non-human actors, and in a network take the shape that they do by virtue of their relations with one another. 
A car is an example of a complex system. It contains many electronic and mechanical components, all of which are essentially hidden from view to the driver, who simply deals with the car as a single object. This effect is known as punctualisation, and is similar to the idea of encapsulation in object-oriented programming.
 In his book Pandora’s Hope, Latour likens depunctualization to the opening of a black box. When closed, the box is perceived simply as a box, although when it is opened all elements inside it becomes visible.

 The distinction between intermediaries and mediators is key to ANT sociology. Intermediaries are entities which make no difference (to some interesting state of affairs which we are studying) and so can be ignored. They transport the force of some other entity more or less without transformation and so are fairly uninteresting. Mediators are entities which multiply difference and so should be the object of study. Their outputs cannot be predicted by their inputs.

 social things—like class distinctions in taste in the silk and nylon example, but also groups and power—must constantly be constructed or performed anew through complex engagements with complex mediators.

 reification:  the nature of social relationships is expressed by the relationships between traded objects

 non-places (Auge 1995), social encounters, sensory experience

cycling is embodied and performative

in an embodied practice such as ycling, notions of place are less reliant on the visual

# Experiment idea

Dynamic-speed time-lapse video of a cycling experience. Sense of being-there, seeing-there, feeling-there.
Make time lapse video, where it goes faster when you are alone, and slower the bigger the group of people you ride with is.

how to record: visual - gopro; social - custom app to go up and down over time. easier: record audio, just say the number of people you ride with when it changes. can easily be mapped later on. also record gps maybe...

making-there

what does time lapse add to still photo images?

to capture “fleeting, ephemeral and often embodied and sensory aspects
of movement” (Spinney 2011, 162)

Urban public space is the single most important element in
establishing a city’s livability...When community members frequently
pass through a traffic free urban space running errands, going shopping, going to work or school, they recognize other frequent
users of the space, and exchange greetings, which in time develop
into conversations. Spontaneous social contacts are the seeds from
which sense of community evolves. (1995: 25)

Since the majority of social interactions are indirect, Goffman’s account
means this entire negotiation frequently happens tacitly. Thus, the
majority of social interactions for bicyclists happen indirectly. This
means bicycle facilities that foster social interaction should be designed
for indirect, non-verbal social interactions. - Cromwell
