These rides represent a mobility practice where the main aim of participants may be ‘leisure’ but most infrastructure used is designated for ‘transport’. Using ethnographic methods, the article provides an analysis of rhythm, positioning and communication on two group rides, one from Hull into the East Yorkshire countryside and one in London. External (including motor traffic flow and route type) and internal (including group composition and experience) factors shape the relationship between the riders and their ride, and hence the mobile places that they co-create. The article argues that cyclists riding in groups create distinctively flexible social spaces. These group cycling practices variously challenge, mimic and adapt to the motorized orientation of much road space.},

A common task performed by bikers is to find good routes in an area, where the quality of a route is based on safety, efficiency, and enjoyment. Finding routes involves trial and error as well as exchanging information between members of a bike community. Biketastic is a platform that enriches this experimentation and route sharing process making it both easier and more effective. Using a mobile phone application and online map visualization, bikers are able to document and share routes, ride statistics, sensed information to infer route roughness and noisiness, and media that documents ride experience. Biketastic was designed to ensure the link between information gathering, visualization, and bicycling practices. In this paper, we present architecture and algorithms for route data inferences and visualization. We evaluate the system based on feedback from bicyclists provided during a two-week pilot.},

	abstract = {The group-cycling behaviours of over 16,000 members of the London Cycle Hire Scheme ({LCHS}), a large public bikeshare system, are identified and analysed. Group journeys are defined as trips made by two or more cyclists together in space and time. Detailed insights into group-cycling behaviour are generated using specifically designed visualization software. We find that in many respects group-cycle journeys fit an expected pattern of discretionary activity: group journeys are more likely at weekends, late evenings and lunchtimes; they generally take place within more pleasant parts of the city; and between individuals apparently known to each other. A separate set of group activity is found, however, that coincides with commuting peaks and that appears to be imposed onto {LCHS} users by the scheme’s design. Studying the characteristics of individuals making group journeys, we identify a group of less experienced {LCHS} cyclists that appear to make more spatially extensive journeys than they would do normally while cycling with others; and that female cyclists are more likely to make late evening journeys when cycling in groups. For 20\% of group cyclists, the first journey ever made through the {LCHS} was a group journey; this is particularly surprising since just 9\% of all group cyclists’ journeys are group journeys. Moreover, we find that women are very significantly (p \&lt; 0.001) overrepresented amongst these ‘first time group cyclists’. Studying the bikeshare cyclists, or bike share ‘friends’, that individuals make ‘first time group journeys’ with, we find a significantly high incidence (p \&lt; 0.001) of group journeys being made with friends of the opposite gender, and for a very large proportion (55\%) of members these first ever journeys are made with a friend that shares the same postcode. A substantial insight, then, is that group cycling appears to be a means through which early {LCHS} usage is initiated.},

	abstract = {The reduction of {CO}2 emissions constitutes one of the largest challenges of the current era. Sustainable transportation, and especially cycling, can contribute to the mitigation of {CO}2 emissions since cycling possesses an intrinsic zero-emission value. Few studies have been conducted that appraise the {CO}2 reduction potential of cycling. Opportunity costs enable the estimation of avoided {CO}2 emissions resulting from bicycle trips. The methodology developed in this research allows the attribution of a climate value to cycling by substituting bicycle trips with their most likely alternative transportation modes and calculating the resulting additional {CO}2 emissions. The methodology uses data on the current modal shares of cycling mobility, the competition of cycling with other transportation modes, and {CO}2 emission factors to calculate the climate value of cycling. When it is assumed that the avoided {CO}2 emissions of cycling mobility could be traded on financial carbon markets, the climate value of cycling represents a monetary value. Application of the methodology to the case of Bogotá, Colombia — a city with a current bicycle modal share of 3.3\% on a total of 10 million daily trips — results in a climate value of cycling of 55,115 tons of {CO}2 per year, corresponding to an economic value of between 1 and 7 million {US} dollars when traded on the carbon market.},

Focus groups were conducted to understand the impact of this programme and to inform future community-based initiatives targeting urban youth. Five themes were derived from the qualitative analysis, comprising benefits of cycling, barriers to cycling, cycling knowledge, support from family and friends, and self efficacy. Earn-A-Bike was well accepted by urban youth, who reported positive perceptions and intentions to continue cycling after the conclusion of the programme. {NBW} is an example of how local non-profits can integrate into urban communities, creating a positive impact on urban children’s lives from a health, cultural and educational perspective.},

	abstract = {In this study, we used the wireless sensor network technique to design the following three modules: a bike device module, bike path establishment module, and cloud service module. These three modules were used to address issues related to cycling activities, including green power supply, activity and health records, trajectory monitoring and group positioning, and immediate safety issues. The cloud service module also includes a path establishment simulation system that enables a path manager to simulate paths before they are physically provided to determine the ideal establishment method for providing wireless sensor nodes. Each module designed in this study is extendable and independent. These modules can be used to rapidly increase the establishment range of bicycle paths and to easily maintain existing paths. The module designs and service frameworks proposed in this study can be employed for large-scale establishment and installation, such as in national forest parks, to enable park management to control the location and safety of tourists easily.},

	abstract = {Open source software projects rely on the voluntary efforts of thousands of software developers, yet we know little about why developers choose to participate in this collective development process. This paper inductively derives a framework for understanding participation from the perspective of the individual software developer based on data from two software communities with different governance structures. In both communities, a need for software-related improvements drives initial participation. The majority of participants leave the community once their needs are met, however, a small subset remains involved. For this set of developers, motives evolve over time and participation becomes a hobby. These hobbyists are critical to the long-term viability of the software code: They take on tasks that might otherwise go undone and work to maintain the simplicity and modularity of the code. Governance structures affect this evolution of motives. Implications for firms interested in implementing hybrid strategies designed to combine the advantages of open source software development with proprietary ownership and control are discussed.
